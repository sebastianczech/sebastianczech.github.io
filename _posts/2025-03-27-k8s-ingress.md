Access to applications (not only those running on the `Kubernetes` platform) should be properly secured, meaning users must authenticate correctly (e.g., using a password) and obtain proper authorization (have the required permissions). There are many ways and standards to achieve this. In the repository [Ingress Nginx controller with authentication](https://github.com/sebastianczech/k8s-ingress-auth), I have prepared an example of applications running on a locally created `Kubernetes` cluster, where access is secured using:
- `bearer token`
- `OAuth`
- certificate
- login and password

I hope these simple examples illustrate the differences in application security methods well and also serve as a good starting point for more advanced configurations :)
