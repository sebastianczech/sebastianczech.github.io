[Kubernetes Goat](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/) is interactive Kubernetes security learning playground, which can allow you to practice several scenarios and learn best practices.

How to start working with **Kubernetes Goat**? At first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat
cd kubernetes-goat
```

Then create local Kubernetes cluster e.g. using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/):

```
kind create cluster --name home-lab
```

After Kubernetes cluster is up, configure **Kubernetes Goat**:

```
chmod +x setup-kubernetes-goat.sh
bash setup-kubernetes-goat.sh
```

And forward ports using script:

```
bash access-kubernetes-goat.sh
```

Then **Kubernetes Goat** GUI can be accessed by URL: [http://127.0.0.1:1234](http://127.0.0.1:1234).

After finishing your work, you can clean your environment by just removing Kubernetes cluster:

```
kind delete cluster --name home-lab
```
