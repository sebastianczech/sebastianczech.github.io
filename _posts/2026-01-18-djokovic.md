I usually write about IT, DevOps, and Cloud technologies, but today I'm sharing something different that resonated with me deeply.

In a recent episode of the [On Purpose podcast with Jay Shetty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAoefT3VJc), Novak Djokovic opened up about his mental battles and the powerful mindset shift that transformed his approach to tennis and life. Despite being one of the greatest athletes of all time, Djokovic admits that he constantly battles internal struggles: "I might appear locked in… but trust me there's a storm inside."

His key insight? Mental strength isn't about eliminating negative thoughts—it's about not lingering in them. As his mental coach taught him from a Zen master's wisdom: "No one on this planet lives without negative thoughts. The difference is how long you stay in them."

Djokovic trains his mind daily through meditation, visualization, prayer, and journaling. His message is clear: mental toughness isn't a gift—it's developed through consistent work, just like any physical skill.

Why am I sharing this? Because whether you're debugging code, managing cloud infrastructure, or facing any professional challenge, the mental game is often the hardest part. Djokovic's approach offers a practical framework for anyone struggling with self-doubt.

I highly encourage you to watch the full episode. The lessons on mental resilience apply far beyond sports.
