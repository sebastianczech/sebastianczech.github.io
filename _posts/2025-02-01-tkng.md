While learning Kubernetes networking, I found out great [Kubernetes Networking Guide](https://www.tkng.io/), which not only explains basics, but also provides detailed description of multiple CNI plugins and advanced configurations e.g. for IPv6.

There is also [lab repository](https://github.com/networkop/tkng-labs), which can be great starting point to learn networking in Kubernetes.
