In order to practice with Terraform and AWS, recently I've made few pull requests to Terraform AWS modules for Lambda:
- [fix: Make default tag terraform-aws-modules optional](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/pull/657)

and VPC:
- [feat: Define default name for VPC endpoint](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/pull/1151)
- [feat!: Add ability to configure IPAM exclusively for IPv4 or IPv6](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/pull/1155)
- [feat: Enhancing VPC Security with Amazon VPC Block Public Access](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/pull/1159)

3 pull requests (from 4 opened) have been already merged, so I'm happy that I'm able to contribute to open source :)
