Are you looking for practical examples and hands-on labs to enhance your skills in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)? The [AKS labs](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/) offers grab-and-go resources that cover a wide range of AKS scenarios, from basic cluster setup to advanced configurations and integrations.

Another great resource is the [AKS Engineering Blog](https://blog.aks.azure.com/), which provides insights, best practices, and updates.

Beside that official materials from Microsoft could be also very helpful e.g. [AKS Reference Architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-start-here), which offer detailed guidance on designing and deploying AKS solutions based on real-world scenarios.
